Passionate about technology, I have always loved everything related to computers, whether closely or remotely. I dedicated a lot of my time to sports and video games.

Later on, I discovered web development, and eventually, I decided to devote much more of my time to it. I took the time to choose online courses, follow tutorials, and work on various projects. Now, I aim to professionalize myself and share as many projects as possible.

So, follow me, and don't hesitate to reuse what you find.

> ### Surprising Skills
> - I make incredibly bad jokes in French, but also in English. For example: Mr. and Mrs. The World have a son, what do they call him? Aroun, arround the world.
> - I have been very active in the field of sports, and at the ages of 15 and 19, I managed to break two records in long jump and swimming during my high school years.
> - I am a big fan of Walker, Texas Ranger.

> ### The favorite things in this universe
> - We can always create, invent, and build.
> - Family life.
> - South Park!

> ### What I appreciate the most in a group
> - Cheerfulness.
> - Responsiveness.
> - Cooperation.

## About me at BeCode
As a JavaScript enthusiast, I'm keen on enhancing my back-end development skills while continuing to improve my expertise in front-end technologies. My goal is to become a more versatile and well-rounded developer, capable of crafting comprehensive and high-performing solutions, whether on the server or client side. 

I am convinced that BeCode is the perfect place to develop my skills and gain experience working in groups.

If I were to share a fear about this training, it would be the challenge of finding an internship or the worry that my projects may not be convincing enough. That's why I dedicate myself 200% every day.
