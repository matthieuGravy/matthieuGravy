# 👋 Hello, I'm Matthieu

Full-stack developer from Belgium. I create web solutions that work in real life for real businesses.

## 🎯 My Background

I'm not a typical developer. Before coding, I worked in security and management. This experience helps me understand what businesses really need.

- 🔍 **I listen first, then code** - Your problems are more important than technical details
- 🏗️ **Smart foundations** - I use proven solutions and adapt them to your needs
- 🌍 **Local focus** - I work with small businesses in Belgium (Wallonia-Brussels)
- 🤝 **Human approach** - Technology should be simple for people to use

## 💼 What I Offer

### Vision Corporate
Professional websites with solid foundations, customized for your business.

### Project Evolution  
I improve existing websites instead of rebuilding everything - cheaper and safer.

### Open Source
I share useful tools and code with the developer community.

## 💻 Technologies I Use

**Frontend:** TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express  
**Special skills:** Multi-language websites, fast performance, easy-to-use interfaces

## 🗣️ Languages
- 🇫🇷 French (Native)
- 🇬🇧 English (Good level)
- 🇳🇱 Dutch (Learning)
