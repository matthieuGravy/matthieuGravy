Passionate about technology, I have always loved everything related to computers, whether closely or remotely. I dedicated a lot of my time to sports and video games.

Later on, I discovered web development, and eventually, I decided to devote much more of my time to it. I took the time to choose online courses, follow tutorials, and work on various projects. Now, I aim to professionalize myself and share as many projects as possible.

So, follow me, and don't hesitate to reuse what you find.

> - I am a big fan of Walker, Texas Ranger.

> ### The favorite things in this universe
> - We can always create, invent, and build.
> - Family life.

## About me at BeCode
As a JavaScript enthusiast, I'm keen on enhancing my back-end development skills while continuing to improve my expertise in front-end technologies. My goal is to become a more versatile and well-rounded developer, capable of crafting comprehensive and high-performing solutions, whether on the server or client side. 

I am convinced that BeCode is the perfect place to develop my skills and gain experience working in groups.

If I were to share a fear about this training, it would be the challenge of finding an internship or the worry that my projects may not be convincing enough. That's why I dedicate myself 200% every day.
